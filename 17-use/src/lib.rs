// Before this change, external code would have to call the add_to_waitlist function by using the path restaurant::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist(), which also would have required the front_of_house module to be marked as pub.
// Now that this pub use has re-exported the hosting module from the root module, external code can use the path restaurant::hosting::add_to_waitlist() instead.
pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting; // re exporting

pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
    hosting::add_to_waitlist();
}

// Note that use only creates the shortcut for the particular scope in which the use occurs.
mod customer {
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        // different scope than the use statement, so the function body won’t compile
        // hosting::add_to_waitlist();
